# MYND_Public_Code
This is a side project I have been working on related to the topics of consciousness and computation. All files have some basis in either peer reviewed research papers or academic books.
The current stage consists of trying to visually describe theories related to consciousness. MYND is an acroynm for 'machine yearning novel discovery'.
